\title{Compute robust multivariate scaled data}
\usage{
mvscale(
  object,
  center = stats::median,
  scale = robustbase::s_Qn,
  cov = robustbase::covOGK,
  warning = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A vector, matrix, or data frame containing some numerical data.}

\item{center}{A function to compute the center of each numerical variable. Set
to NULL if no centering is required.}

\item{scale}{A function to scale each numerical variable. When
`cov = robustbase::covOGK`, it is passed as the `sigmamu` argument.}

\item{cov}{A function to compute the covariance matrix. Set to NULL if no rotation required.}

\item{warning}{Should a warning be issued if non-numeric columns are ignored?}
}
\value{
A vector, matrix or data frame of the same size and class as `object`,
but with numerical variables replaced by scaled versions.
}
\description{
A multivariate version of `base::scale()`, that takes account
of the covariance matrix of the data, and uses robust estimates
of center, scale and covariance by default. The centers are removed using medians, the
scale function is the IQR, and the covariance matrix is estimated using a
robust OGK estimate. The data are scaled using the Cholesky decomposition of
the inverse covariance. Then the scaled data are returned. This is useful for
computing pairwise Mahalanobis distances.
}
\details{
Optionally, the centering and scaling can be done for each variable
separately, so there is no rotation of the data, by setting `cov = NULL`.
Also optionally, non-robust methods can be used by specifying `center = mean`,
scale = `stats::sd`, and `cov = stats::cov`. Any non-numeric columns are retained
with a warning.

# Univariate z-scores (no rotation)
mvscale(oldfaithful, center = mean, scale = sd, cov = NULL, warning = FALSE)
# Non-robust scaling with rotation
mvscale(oldfaithful, center = mean, cov = stats::cov, warning = FALSE)
mvscale(oldfaithful, warning = FALSE)
# Robust Mahalanobis distances
